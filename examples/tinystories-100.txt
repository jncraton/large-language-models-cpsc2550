Once there was a boy who liked to run. Every day he ran faster and faster. He was so fast that he seemed to float rather than run! One day, his mommy gave him a weight to carry. It was big and heavy, but the boy didnaEUR(tm)t mind. He held on tightly and ran with it, as if it were nothing.

He ran for hours and hours, never stopping for a rest. The weight grew heavier and heavier, but the boy never thought about it. He kept on running, ever faster and ever further.

Then, all of a sudden, the boy felt himself trip! He had been so careless, he couldnaEUR(tm)t keep his footing. He had been running too fast and too far, with too much weight in his hands. The weight had been too heavy for him, and as he fell, he knew that he had gone much too far. Now it was time to turn around and run back home.
