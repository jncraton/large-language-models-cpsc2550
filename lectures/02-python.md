Instucting Computers
--------------------

- In order to interact with computer systems they must be provided with instructions
- These instruction can arrive as voice, natural language, button presses, or typed instructions

Python
------

- Python provides a language that can be used to describe instruction to a computer

Example
-------

```python
print(1+1)
```

Notebook
--------

- Python notebooks can be useful tools to describe instructions in a interactive, repeatable, and sharable way
- In this course, we will be using Colab or local Jupyter notebooks to complete some coursework
