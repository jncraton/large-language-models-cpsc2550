Simple Language Models
----------------------

n-grams
-------

- n-gram is a sequence of n adjacent symbols in particular order
- Examples include letters in a word or words in a text
- A unigram (or 1-gram) would be a single word

Hard-coded bigram model
------------------------

- Considers only the previous word when determining the next
- We write the rules to determine the next word
- No machine learning involved
