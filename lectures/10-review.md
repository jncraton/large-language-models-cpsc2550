Model
-----

- A model is an informative representation of an object, person, or system.

Language Model
--------------

- Probabilistic model of a natural language

Bigram Language Model
---------------------

- Extremely limited model
- Only considers the previous word while predicting the next

Token
-----

- Small segment of text
- May be an entire word
- May be multiple words
- May be a single character

Machine Learning
----------------

- Building algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data

Training
--------

- The process of learning model parameters from data

Token Embedding
---------------

- The meaning of a token in vector space
- Learned by a model so that tokens with similar meanings can map to similar vectors

Document Embedding
------------------

- The meaning of a document in vector space
- Learned by a model so that documents with similar meanings can map to similar vectors

Quantization
------------

- Lowers precision of model parameters
- Reduces size of stored model
- Can improve inference performance

Transformers
------------

- Popular machine learning architecture
- Achieves excellent results in many areas
- Scales to larger models more effectively than prior architectures
